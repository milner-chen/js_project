# Background
Cat Collector is a game where you help a cat with its errands by collecting everything on it's to-do list. However, this cat is very peculiar so you must gather these items in the order listed. If you try to collect items out of order, you will receive a warning. When you run out of warnings, you will lose a life. If collected properly, you will gain points. The game ends when time is up or when you lose all your lives. There are also perils out in the wild so be careful when foraging!
